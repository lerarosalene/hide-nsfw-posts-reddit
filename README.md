## Reddit Userscript: Hide NSFW posts from certain subreddits

This userscript allows to hide NSFW posts from subreddit feeds.

### Limitations

- It doesn't work on global feed as one may expect: it either hides all NSFW posts from global feed or doesn't hide any.

Install with userscript manager: <a href="https://lerarosalene.github.io/hide-nsfw-posts-reddit/latest/hide-nsfw-posts-reddit.user.js">latest</a>

You can also grab not-autoupdated version from <a href="https://github.com/lerarosalene/hide-nsfw-posts-reddit/releases">Releases</a>.

### Build it yourself

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```
